## Introduction: 
*What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution.*

This project will support users in their ability to create a grocery shopping list that enables them to minimize their number of trips to different grocery stores, while maximizing savings. This will particularly help younger and older adults who live in areas with multiple grocery store options figure out where they can get the best deals for the items on their grocery lists.

## Clear design statement: 
*What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project?*

This project addressess users' esteem needs, involving a sense of prestige and a feeling of accomplishment. While the project may seem to address physiological needs on the surface due to its enhancement of food accessibility, the project overarchingly targets users' esteem needs because users are likely to feel more accomplished after completing their grocery shopping in a timely, costly manner.
