# Creating Safer Free and For-Sale Platforms
## DH110: Heuristic Evaluation by Claire Dinauer

## Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace Postings
> As long as I can remember, my parents enjoyed using Craigslist to locate affordable furniture and services for our family to use. However, scrolling through Craigslist myself, I consistently found fishy listings, sometimes many of the same exact listing, with poor or unclear options for contacting the lister that required little-to-no verification of identity. Additionally, since attending college, my eyes have been opened to different local virtual marketplaces that made being a college student easier and more affordable, specifically in terms of purchasing textbooks from other students for my classes or purchasing used furniture for my apartment. I, along with many other university students, use Facebook Marketplace to post listings of our items to students or other individuals within a certain radius of our loaction. Looking at these two sites, I wanted to delve into what makes a "community marketplace" user-friendly and safe for a wide range of age groups, and what may need to be improved to optimize safety, accessibility, and overall site design.

### Craigslist
*Craigslist is a website for viewing and posting advertisements or listings devoted to jobs, housing, for sale, items wanted, services, community service, gigs, resumes, and discussion forums. The site has been around since 1995 and has served to operate like the classifieds section of a newspaper.*

#### Evaluation
*Craigslist lacks aesthetic organization, especially due to its cluttered style and lack of engaging visualizations that could make the site easier to navigate. While the website is newspaper-esque, it could use some updates to be more visually appealing, in which certain enhancements could make navigating the site easier. The website also has a notably high scam and setup rate, which makes it risky for elder populations and younger children or teens to use who may be less familiar with navigating scams.*

#### Evaluation

Overall: The CCLE Mobile App has a long way to go until it measures up to the CCLE webpage. There are many striking issues and the major one being that it is not properly synched to the students schedule. If all current classes are not on the app, there is no reason in the first place to use the app. In its current state the app is not used to its full capacity. There are many consistency errors that need to be fixed along with ease of usability.*
