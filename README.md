# Creating Safe, Accessible Community Marketplaces 
DH110: Heuristic Evaluation by Claire Dinauer

## Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace Postings
> As long as I can remember, my parents enjoyed using Craigslist to locate affordable furniture and services for our family to use. However, scrolling through Craigslist myself, I consistently found fishy listings, sometimes many of the same exact listing, with poor or unclear options for contacting the lister that required little-to-no verification of identity. Additionally, since attending college, my eyes have been opened to different local virtual marketplaces that made being a college student easier and more affordable, specifically in terms of purchasing textbooks from other students for my classes or purchasing used furniture for my apartment. I, along with many other university students, use Facebook Marketplace to post listings of our items to students or other individuals within a certain radius of our loaction. Looking at these two sites, I wanted to delve into what makes a "community marketplace" user-friendly and safe for a wide range of age groups, and what may need to be improved to optimize safety, accessibility, and overall site design.

## Severity Ratings for Usability Issues
Sourced from [Nielson Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)
1: Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project
2: Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority
3: Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority

### Website 1: [Craigslist](https://losangeles.craigslist.org/)
*Craigslist is a website for viewing and posting advertisements or listings devoted to jobs, housing, for sale, items wanted, services, community service, gigs, resumes, and discussion forums. The site has been around since 1995 and has served to operate like the classifieds section of a newspaper.*

#### Evaluation
*Craigslist lacks aesthetic organization, especially due to its cluttered style and lack of engaging visualizations that could make the site easier to navigate. While the website is newspaper-esque, it could use some updates to be more visually appealing, in which certain enhancements could make navigating the site easier. The website also has a notably high scam and setup rate, which makes it risky for elder populations and younger children or teens to use who may be less familiar with navigating scams.*

Heuristic & Description | Heuristic Evaluation | Improvement | Rating 
--------------------------|----------------------|------------|--------
**Visibility of system status:** The web/app gives the user feedback in a timely manner concerning the actions they are currently doing. | **Good:** The search bar changes based on which topic or forum you are exploring, making it somewhat clear where you are. Users can also view subcategories based on the category they are searching.| **Improvement:** Make the topic of exploration larger at the top, center of the page rather than tucked into the top left. | **Rating:** 1
**Match between system and real world:** Design and icons are based off of general knowledge. Things the user will easily recognize. | **Good:** New additions to the website are labeled with a small, orange "new" tag, making new content noticable to users. **Bad:** The "event calendar" on the home page of the website directs users to a list of events, services, and products, many of which are unrelated to "events". | **Improvement:** The calendar should appear as an actual calendar, with clear dates and times that are relevant to actual events. The peace sign logo for craigslist in the tab bar seems to be unrelated to the actual content of the website.| **Rating:** 2
**User control and freedom:** User has options, such as undo or redo. | **Good:** Users can navigate forward and back between categories and listings. When users go back, they are brought to the same spot that they were on the previous page. Users can also customize their search based on how many miles away they would like something to be. Users can also set preferences for how they view listings, whether in a list, gallery, map, or thumbnail style. There is also a "back to top" option for users to return to the top of the page after scrolling.| **Improvement:** Offer an additional back button at the top of the page for users to navigate back.| **Rating:** 1
**Consistency and standards:** Design and usage is consistent across all pages of the web/app. | **Good:** Text size and availability of a search bar is consistent across the webpages. While surfing the site, there are consistent drop-down menus on the left-most side of the page. These drop-down menus will only change based on the topic being viewed to remain relevant. **Bad:** The informational pages of the site are inconsistently organized, sometimes with missing information and variation between style.| **Improvement:** Adjust the privacy policy, terms of use, system status, and other pages unrelated to listings to have consistent visuals, as there is variation in the setup of each of these informational pages. | **Rating:** 2
**Error prevention:** Provide safety nets for user, such as confirming an action. | **Good:** Users must confirm that they are not a robot before viewing a lister's contact information. **Bad:** Users are encouraged to contact sellers outside the website, and so Craigslist does not often supervise who is reaching out to whom. | **Improvements:** While the website offers information about avoiding scams, there are no flags indicating whether a user or listing is legitimate. The website should encourage users to reply directly to listings through the website, and notify users if suspicious activity may be detected.| **Rating:** 3
**Recognition rather than recall:** Provide suggestions or context in actions. | **Good:** Offers overall suggestions for what users can search. When using the search bar, the site will offer related categories to narrow the search. **Bad:** Search function may automatically select a subtopic for you if you do not select one. | **Improvement:** Do not allow the search function to automatically select a subtopic, as this causes the user to restart their search to some extent. | **Rating:** 2
**Flexibility and efficiency of use:** Make a page that is accessible to all, have basic functions at the forefront and more advanced options accessible through more steps. |**Good:** General settings and then more advanced, less used ones separate, such as synching. **Bad:** Sometimes there is extra navigation involved that does not require it, there is only one option in each navigation step. | **Improvement:** Depending on how many options in each setting step, reduce the amount of steps to get to the end option. | **Rating:** 2
**Aesthetic and minimalist design:** Design is not cluttered and easily accessible. | **Bad:** The website is cluttered, with nearly all possible topics listed out on the home page. The font is nearly all the same size, making it difficult to see where to make a listing. | **Improvement:** Implement larger, more clear buttons for users to create listings. Also add visualizations that coincide with each overall topic. | **Rating:** 3
**Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:** Have a non-concerning message about an error and give information on how to fix it of move forward. | **Bad:** Error notifications are not available on listings, or they are unclear to the user. Any errors in the website appear to pertain to the programmers of the site.| **Improvement:** Enable error notifications for users, and allow users to toggle with the settings. | **Rating:** 3
**Help and documentation:** Have easily accessible and understandable help pages or pages with commonly asked questions. | **Good:** The site offers FAQs, help, personal safety tips, terms of use, and privacy policy pages. The links included in the FAQ pages are useful for step-by-step instructions on how to solve different common issues. Users can also conduct a search within the FAQ page. | **Improvement:** The help desk forum is cluttered and its purpose is unclear. An active messaging system between Craigslist and users may be helpful for solving more niche issues. | **Rating:** 1

### Website 2: [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/)
*Facebook Martketplace is an open exchange where users can buy and sell new and pre-owned items to other users, in which searches can be narrowed based on location. Any users can list products or services for sale and gain access to a local audience. The website also groups items or forums into categories, such as electronics, clothing, family, free items, hobbies, real estate, and supplies. Facebook Marketplace also caters users' home page to previously viewed items or to items that the website believes the user may be interested in.*

#### Evaluation
*Facebook Marketplace is notably more visually appealing and simple to navigate for both buyers and sellers. The use of an algorithm to offer "Picks for You" could use improvements, as it may be based on slim availability of data based on a user's former activity. Because Facebook originated as a social media platform to enhance community, Facebook Marketplace is able to combine the community aspects of their site to make selling feel more personable and safe. The ability to directly message other users through the marketplace platform make seller and buyer identities more verifiable. The platform aims to be user-friendly by generating automated potential responses to listings in the marketplace. There are fewer improvements for the site to make in comparison to Craigslist.*
