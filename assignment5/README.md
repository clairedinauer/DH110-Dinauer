# Low Fidelity Prototype for GrocerySaver
DH 110: Low Fidelity Prototype by Claire Dinauer

## ðŸ—£ Project Description

This low-fidelity prototyping project aims to assist users with the efficiency and cost of their grocery shopping trips. The target audience is for any young adult and older who does their own grocery shopping, or shops for their family, who seeks to save both time and money. These users likely have busy lives, whether as students, parents, or full-time workers, who may want to have more time to spend with their family or doing hobbies outside rather than spending too much time circling the grocery store looking for products and spending more money than necessary. Based on my user research, the following features are focused on helping users save time and money when creating their shopping lists and conducting their grocery trips:

1. **Recipe Recommendations** - recommends what recipes users can make based off the items they are adding to their shopping list <br/>
2. **Coupons Tool** - recommends coupons for users based on the items they are adding to cart, in which users can digitally save the coupons their device to use at check-out <br/>
3. **Aisle Labeling** - indicates where users can find each item in their respective store, as well as an overall summary list of the aisles in which the user will need to visit

My target users were created around the ideals of a balance between cost-efficient and time-efficient shopping, enabling users to take advantage of multiple stores in their area, if applicable. My two personas were a 21-year-old college student and 39-year-old genetics counselor and mother, each of whom desired more time focusing on their priorities (i.e. studying or spending time with family). My personas also prioritize ease of organization and making the most of their budgets. The college student wants to know his way around his university's local grocery stores, while optimizing his study time and staying within his monthly budget. The full-time genetics counselor/parent wants to seek new recipes for her family and to keep her grocery lists and coupons organized.

**Project Purpose:** Overall, the purpose for conducting this low-fidelity prototype is to test the functionality and ease-of-usability of the features that I designed with my target audience in mind. I want to gauge the efficiency of each of the features and understand what may be confusing to users, allowing me to figure out what I may need to adjust in my GrocerySaver application to ensure that users get the most out of each feature and the application as a whole.
