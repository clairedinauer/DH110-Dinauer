# Low Fidelity Prototype for GrocerySaver
DH 110: Low Fidelity Prototype by Claire Dinauer

## Project Description

This low-fidelity prototyping project aims to assist users with the efficiency and cost of their grocery shopping trips. The target audience is for any young adult and older who does their own grocery shopping, or shops for their family, who seeks to save both time and money. These users likely have busy lives, whether as students, parents, or full-time workers, who may want to have more time to spend with their family or doing hobbies outside rather than spending too much time circling the grocery store looking for products and spending more money than necessary. Based on my user research, the following features are focused on helping users save time and money when creating their shopping lists and conducting their grocery trips:

1. **Recipe Recommendations** - recommends what recipes users can make based off the items they are adding to their shopping list <br/>
2. **Coupons Tool** - recommends coupons for users based on the items they are adding to cart, in which users can digitally save the coupons their device to use at check-out <br/>
3. **Aisle Labeling** - indicates where users can find each item in their respective store, as well as an overall summary list of the aisles in which the user will need to visit

My target users were created around the ideals of a balance between cost-efficient and time-efficient shopping, enabling users to take advantage of multiple stores in their area, if applicable. My two personas were a 21-year-old college student and 39-year-old genetics counselor and mother, each of whom desired more time focusing on their priorities (i.e. studying or spending time with family). My personas also prioritize ease of organization and making the most of their budgets. The college student wants to know his way around his university's local grocery stores, while optimizing his study time and staying within his monthly budget. The full-time genetics counselor/parent wants to seek new recipes for her family and to keep her grocery lists and coupons organized.

**Project Purpose:** Overall, the purpose for conducting this low-fidelity prototype is to test the functionality and ease-of-usability of the features that I designed with my target audience in mind. I want to gauge the efficiency of each of the features and understand what may be confusing to users, allowing me to figure out what I may need to adjust in my GrocerySaver application to ensure that users get the most out of each feature and the application as a whole.

## Flow and Description

**Flow Description:**

The flow designed below allows users to find help, search for products, and select/view products. The user can access the help page and search for help, click a help topic, or contact Amazon. When the user searches for help, they will be directed to a search results page where the user can find top results of pages containing the user's searched keywords. When the user clicks a help topic, they will be taken to the main page for the topic where they can access features to walk them through their concerns or needs. In addition, the flow designed allows the user to search for products in the search bar in the heading of the website. This will direct users to a list of search results and categories of results. If the user clicks on one of the categories, the page will refresh to show products that fit within that category. Users can also click on the filters they want to manipulate, which will drop down to show the filter features that the user can change to fit their wants and needs. When the user finishes implementing the filters, they press "Apply" to apply the filter and the screen will refresh to show the filtered results. Users can click on a product which will direct them to the product screen where they can view product details and add the item into their cart.

**Features Description:**
> 1. Recipes: The "Recipes" button is located at the menu at the bottom of the home and several relevant pages. The user can click this button to view all of their recipes, in which they can search through their saved recipes. Users can also note whether an item has recommended recipes if the item has a chef's hat icon next to it.
> 2. Coupons: The "Coupons" button is located at the menu at the bottom of the home and several relevant pages. The user can view all of their clipped coupons for each relevant store, and click on the coupon to open up the scannable code for check-out. Users can see if an item has a coupon if it has a box with an exclamation point next to it.
> 3. Aisles: The user can view the aisles in which each item is located when viewing more specific details about the product in a store and when viewing their "Current List".

*Features are labeled numerically in the flow above, and all three features are identifiable in the product information page below.*

## Test Scenarios

To test each feature, I asked my participant to do what she thought she should do in different scenarios. I asked her to circle and/or draw what she would do, as well as write down what she did for clarity.

1. **Recipe Recommendations:** asking the user to find a recommendations for recipes based on their desired products.
> My study participant was able to successfully access the "Recipes" icon, in which they stated they would search through the recipes that they had.

2. **Coupons Tool:** asking the user to look for an item with a coupon, then clip the coupon, and view their coupons during check-out.

3. **Aisle Labeling:** testing whether the user can construct a shopping list and view the aisles in which their items are located

## Reflection

+1: Summary of the process, what went smoothly or differently from your expectation

+1: What you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing.
