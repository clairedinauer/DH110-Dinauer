# High-Fidelity Prototype for GrocerySaver
DH 110: High Fidelity Prototype by Claire Dinauer

## Project Description

This project is for my GrocerySaver app, in which I am adapting my [low-fidelity prototype](https://github.com/clairedinauer/DH110-Dinauer/tree/main/assignment5) to a high-fidelity prototype format using Figma. The purpose of creating a high-fidelity prototype is to develop, visualize, and engage with a functional version of my app to ensure that the GrocerySaver app is user-friendly and testable. I originally created hand-drawn wireframes and wireflows for my low-fidelity prototype based on my two user personas [Jacob Stern and Maya Hao](https://github.com/clairedinauer/DH110-Dinauer/tree/main/assignment4). Based on user feedback from a test participant, I was sure to make relevant adjustments to my wireflow to be incorportated into the high-fidelity prototype, with improved features, graphic design, and UI/UX material components.

## About the Prototype

This prototype allows users to:

1. **Recipe Recommendations** - recommends what recipes users can make based off the items they are adding to their shopping list <br/>
2. **Coupons Tool** - recommends coupons for users based on the items they are adding to cart, in which users can digitally save the coupons their device to use at check-out <br/>
3. **Aisle Labeling** - indicates where users can find each item in their respective store, as well as an overall summary list of the aisles in which the user will need to visit

## Screen Design

**Three Different Hues:** I created a basic home page, darkmode home page, and a homepage with blue hues.

## Impression Test

0: No evidence of the impression test

+1: Provide the evidence of impression test with the raw data (video/audio recording) or the quotation/transcript

+1: Summary of findings 

### Decisions

**Font:** I used the Manrope font with a variety of boldness and text size between 16-30.

**Buttons**: To direct users' focus, I created buttons with additional graphics or icons to give users' insight into where they will be redirected.

**How I Made My Decisions:**

1: provide a summary of graphic design including

Typeface family + size

Color scheme: background, primary (default text), focus (ex. button)

Layout grid + spacing

+1: Thoughtful description about how you made the decisions for the graphical interface design
