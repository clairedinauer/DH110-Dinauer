# High-Fidelity Prototype for GrocerySaver
DH 110: High Fidelity Prototype by Claire Dinauer

## Project Description

This project is for my GrocerySaver app, in which I am adapting my [low-fidelity prototype](https://github.com/clairedinauer/DH110-Dinauer/tree/main/assignment5) to a high-fidelity prototype format using Figma. The purpose of creating a high-fidelity prototype is to develop, visualize, and engage with a functional version of my app to ensure that the GrocerySaver app is user-friendly and testable. I originally created hand-drawn wireframes and wireflows for my low-fidelity prototype based on my two user personas [Jacob Stern and Maya Hao](https://github.com/clairedinauer/DH110-Dinauer/tree/main/assignment4). Based on user feedback from a test participant, I was sure to make relevant adjustments to my wireflow to be incorportated into the high-fidelity prototype, with improved features, graphic design, and UI/UX material components.

## About the Prototype

**About the Prototype**

This prototype allows users to:

1. **Recipe Recommendations** - recommends what recipes users can make based off the items they are adding to their shopping list <br/>
2. **Coupons Tool** - recommends coupons for users based on the items they are adding to cart, in which users can digitally save the coupons their device to use at check-out <br/>
3. **Aisle Labeling** - indicates where users can find each item in their respective store, as well as an overall summary list of the aisles in which the user will need to visit

## Screen Design

1. Three screen templates
2. One screen template with three design variations

+1:  At least three distinctive screen templates that represent user-interface design with standard graphical components (ex. Material ui component)
+1: Select one screen template (ex. login-page). Provide at least three design variations with different color schemes (ex. light-mode, dark-mode, hue variation)


0: No Evidence of color-contrast check
+1: Provide the evidence of checking the color contrast for the accessibility WCAG2.0 AA level. (ex. Spark plugin test screenshot)

## Color Scheme and Variations

**Three Different Hues:** I created a basic home page, darkmode home page, and a homepage with blue hues.

## Impression Test

0: No evidence of the impression test
+1: Provide the evidence of impression test with the raw data (video/audio recording) or the quotation/transcript
+1: Summary of findings 

### Decisions

1: provide a summary of graphic design including
Typeface family + size
Color scheme: background, primary (default text), focus (ex. button)
Layout grid + spacing
+1: Thoughtful description about how you made the decisions for the graphical interface design
