# UX Design of a Public Library Website
DH 110: Persona + Scenario by Claire Dinauer

## Purpose of UX Storytelling

The purpose of UX storytelling is to understand the user; it allows design teams to gain insights into their usersâ€™ thoughts, behaviors, actions, and contexts. In addition to this, it allows team to connect quickly, to establish an agreed upon perception of their user, so that they may work effectively to design a cohesive product.

## Key Design Features
1) the library catalog
2) the search function within the library's website
3) the library website's organization of information/page titles
