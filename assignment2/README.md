## Introduction 

Craigslist has been a widely used website since its launch in 1995 for viewing and posting advertisements or listings. The website is known for operating like the classifieds section of a newspaper, displaying offerings for community service, jobs, housing, for sale items, and discussion forums. Over the years, its functionalities have expanded yet its aesthetic has remained fairly consistent. Hence, I am interested in performing a usability test for Craigslist to delve into its effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction based on users' behaviors and attitudes. 

## Purpose of Usability Testing

Usability testing (UT) is essential to observing how people use products, specifically websites or apps in this case, while gaining a greater understanding of a product’s effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. UT allows product creators to identify what users find good or bad about the web or app design. Specific issues can be identified by utilizing heuristic evaluation and task tests to determine the extent to which the web or app is effective, efficient, and satisfactory to users, as described above. Unlike heuristic evaluation, UT enables product creators to note participant’s behaviors, attitudes, and thoughts while navigating the product.

## Methodology

The pilot usability test will be conducted over Zoom, with the moderator and participant both sitting in quiet spaces. The moderator and participant will both be using computers with webcams and audio on. The participant will be screen sharing to display the survey and the website, so the moderator can see what the participant is doing while completing each task on the website. The moderator will screenrecord the Zoom conference to record the participant's reactions throughout the test. The screen recording will also include the moderator guiding the participant through the UT survey and tasks. This is a pilot trial, which is meant to test setting, materials, and software to improve the UT process. 

**Process of the usability test:**
* Introduction to the UT
* Informed Consent and Agreement
* Background Questions
* Pre-Test Questionnaire
* Tasks 
* Post-Test Questionnaire
* System Usability Scale (SUS)
* Product Satisfaction Card
* Demographics

The post-test questionnaire and SUS measure how the participant feels regarding the website's ease of use, efficiency, expected frequency of use, accessibility, aesthetics, and content organization. During the Product Satisfaction Card section of the UT, the participant selects five words that characterize their feelings and attitudes about the website, while speaking aloud.

**Tasks are as Follows:**

Heuristic | Usability Issue  | Task  |
:--- | :--- | :--- |
Error prevention  | The website automatically moves forward with every choice the user makes while creating a listing, without confirming their actions  | Create a posting for a particular location and topic | 
Aesthetic and minimalist design  | The website is cluttered, with nearly all possible topics listed out on the home page. The event calendar is oddly organized   | Finding an event to attend for particular dates |
Consistency and standards  | The discussion forums are inconsistently organized, particularly with a very different style than the rest of the website | Find and search through a specific discussion forum |
