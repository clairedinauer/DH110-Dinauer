## Main Design Challenge

**What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?**

This project will support users in their ability to create a grocery shopping list that enables them to minimize their number of trips to different grocery stores, while maximizing savings. This will particularly help younger and older adults who live in areas with multiple grocery store options figure out where they can get the best deals for the items on their grocery lists.

**What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)**

This project addressess users' esteem needs, involving a sense of prestige and a feeling of accomplishment. While the project may seem to address physiological needs on the surface due to its enhancement of food accessibility, the project overarchingly targets users' esteem needs because users are likely to feel more accomplished after completing their grocery shopping in a timely, costly manner.

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**

Currently, I know many individuals who simply write out their grocery lists on paper or in the notes app on their mobile phone. It is satisfying to cross or check off items that have been purchesed from the list. People can also find coupons or search prices for some stores online.

Many grocery stores and merchandise retailers that sell groceries have applications in which shoppers can curate a shopping list, view prices, add coupons, and view which aisles products are located in. In some applications, such as the [Ralph's app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ralphs/id584459861) or [Target app](https://www.target.com/c/target-app/-/N-4th2r?Nao=0), shoppers can add items to their list and check them off as they purchase them.

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**

Because applications for larger stores are specific to providing information regarding products and costs at that one store, an application that utilizes algorithms to compare costs of products and produce across multiple grocery stores will enable users to find the products that they are looking for at the lowest cost. In addition, rather than feeling limited to shopping at one store, users could set location preferences for where they would like to do their grocery shopping within a certain radius, as well as how many stores they may be willing to go to, in order to curate a shopping experience that works best for their time and wallet.

## Target Users 

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 

- **Demographics**: adults, people with families, students (high school or above), older adults
- **Preferences**: users who try to have organized, efficient shopping trips; users who try to go to more than one store to purchase different products; users who try to get the best price when shopping (e.g. clipping coupons, price comparisons)
- **Expertise**: users do not need a specific level of expertise for this project other than having the experience of grocery shopping

#### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)

- Traditionally, shoppers can keep track of their grocery list on a piece of paper, writing down what they need. They may carry the paper with them in the store.
- Digitally, shoppers might write down their grocery list in an app (such as the Notes app on an iPhone), in which they can pull their device out at anytime while shopping.
- When finding coupons or comparing prices, users may look online at a store's website or a store's mobile device application (if available). Users may have an app installed on their phone for a store, where they manage their account or can view their purchase history.

#### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)

- The goal of the users would be to curate a digital shopping list that compares prices across grocer locations to maximize users' time and savings. To accomplish this, users would type their grocery list into their device, which would then recommend which store to go to based on cost, available coupons, and store location. When shopping in-store, users would be able to pull out their device and view their grocery list, in which they can see where products are located in the store (e.g. which aisle). Users would also download and store coupons in their device to use during check-out.

## Picking Research Methods

I chose to use an interview and participatory observation as my methods. 

#### Participatory Observation and Interview:

For participator observation, I gave the user two tasks to complete:
1. *Creating a grocery list by-hand (pen and paper)*: I asked the user to organize their shopping list as they normally would when going to the grocery store. I asked questions regarding why the user set up their list a certain way.
2. *Creating a grocery list in-app (Ralph's App)*: I asked the user to create a shopping list in the Ralph's app and play around with the interface. I asked questions regarding the reliability and usability of the app to understand the user's preferences.

#### Additional Information About Methods:

I conducted these activities in-person with the participant. We sat at a table in my apartment, where the space was clean and the user felt comfortable. I video recorded the conversation using my computer camera, and I adjusted the camera to show the user writing their grocery list when necessary. I also used screen-recoding on the mobile device on which the user created their grocery list in the Ralph's App. The website [otter.ai](otter.ai) was useful to transcribe the conversation.

## Research Materials: Script and Videos

**1. Contextual Inquiry Guide:**

The **script** that I used during the interview can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z0tS3uKGUXR-qxgvsAQXRfvZ3kCcMeRtiJcfXVORXyM/edit?usp=sharing).

**2. User Data:**

The **videos** for the recording of the interview and the screen-recording of the participant using the Ralph's app can be found in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1thzUt6qQAJquKfegJAGIs1oqi27d4Cx0?usp=sharing). The following contents are  in the folder:

*Note: The video recordings were split into a "Video Part 1" and "Video Part 2" due to recording difficulties.* 

The **transcript** of my conversation with the participant can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TCI9dWgIZDmvxE3PBr5gTxNf1ytt21VWozHf8VS1yI0/edit?usp=sharing).
