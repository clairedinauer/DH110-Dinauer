## ðŸ“• Main Design Challenge

**What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?**
This project will support users in their ability to create a grocery shopping list that enables them to minimize their number of trips to different grocery stores, while maximizing savings. This will particularly help younger and older adults who live in areas with multiple grocery store options figure out where they can get the best deals for the items on their grocery lists.

**What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)**

This project addressess users' esteem needs, involving a sense of prestige and a feeling of accomplishment. While the project may seem to address physiological needs on the surface due to its enhancement of food accessibility, the project overarchingly targets users' esteem needs because users are likely to feel more accomplished after completing their grocery shopping in a timely, costly manner.

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**

Many grocery stores and merchandise retailers that sell groceries have applications in which shoppers can curate a shopping list, view prices, add coupons, and view which aisles products are located in. In some applications, such as the [Ralph's app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ralphs/id584459861) or [Target app](https://www.target.com/c/target-app/-/N-4th2r?Nao=0), shoppers can add items to their list and check them off as they purchase them.

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**

Because applications for larger stores are specific to providing information regarding products and costs at that one store, an application that utilizes algorithms to compare costs of products and produce across multiple grocery stores will enable users to find the products that they are looking for at the lowest cost. In addition, rather than feeling limited to shopping at one store, users could set location preferences for where they would like to do their grocery shopping within a certain radius, as well as how many stores they may be willing to go to, in order to curate a shopping experience that works best for their time and wallet.

## ðŸ“™ Target Users 

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 

#### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)

#### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)


## ðŸ“’ Picking Research Methods

Interview with direct / passive / participatory observation.
Or something you learned on your own (refer to the field guideline by IDEO)

## ðŸ“— Plan to get into the context & write down the observation/ interview guide 

Decide where to visit
Decide what activities to observe/ what to ask to do
Decide how to interact with the users 
Decide how to collect user data (ex. Pen-paper notes, voice/video recording, images)
Prepare the interview guide (examples + template here -- this guide is designed for search activity but you need to edit with your contextual questions according to the activity, not search activity, you want to learn from the users)

## ðŸ“˜ Step05: Conduct the research

Visit the place
Meet/Observe the user(s)
Collect the data (record, pictures, answered_survey)

## ðŸ“š Step06: Organize/Documentation

In github (sub)repository assignment4, create one document (either README.md or .html)
Describe your project design challenge + target user (step1+2)
Describe your research methods and plan (step3)
Provide a link to your interview/observation guide (step4) 
Digitize your notes (scan/photo) and upload your data to github
Provide a link to your representative data file(s) (step5)
Provide a link to the transcript of your interview (or meaningful dialogues/ talk-aloud during observation, useful transcript tool here) 
Write a reflection
